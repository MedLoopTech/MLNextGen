# MedLoop NextGen

A from-scratch parallel implementation proving out the "next version" stack proposed for `PharmacyWebapp`: ASP.NET Core 8, PostgreSQL, and real authentication — instead of Firestore and the legacy app's ad hoc session-based auth.

This is **not** a fork of `PharmacyWebapp` and contains none of its code. It's a clean skeleton meant to be extended module by module, following the incremental migration plan written up for the legacy app.

## What's in this skeleton
- ASP.NET Core 8 Web API project, **plus a Blazor Server portal** (see below) in the same project.
- PostgreSQL via EF Core + Npgsql, with migrations applied automatically on startup in Development.
- Real authentication via ASP.NET Core Identity (`AddIdentityApiEndpoints` — built-in `/register`, `/login`, `/refresh` endpoints for API/SPA clients), with role support wired up (`AddRoles<IdentityRole>()`).
- `Dockerfile` that runs as a non-root user out of the box.
- `docker-compose.yml` for local development against a real Postgres instance — no cloud account needed to run this locally.

## ⚠️ The portal has not been compiled or run
This sandbox has no .NET SDK installed, so everything below the API layer was written without the ability to `dotnet build`/`dotnet run` it. The API controllers were built the same way and are lower-risk (plain, well-established ASP.NET Core patterns). **The Blazor Server portal is the single highest-risk part of this repo** — Blazor Server's rendering-mode rules (static vs. interactive component boundaries, where `SignInManager` can and can't write to the HTTP response) are genuinely easy to get subtly wrong without compiling. **Before relying on this, build it locally first** and be ready to fix compiler errors, especially around:
- `Components/App.razor`, `Components/Routes.razor` and the render-mode boundaries between static pages (`Login`, `Register`, `Home`) and interactive ones (`Marketplace`, `Bids`, `Orders`).
- The plain HTTP form-post login/register/logout endpoints in `Program.cs` — this pattern (avoiding Blazor interactive forms specifically so `SignInManager` can write the auth cookie) is correct in principle but the most likely spot for something to need adjusting.

## The B2B portal (Blazor Server)
Added in the same project as the API, not a separate frontend stack — same language, and it plugs directly into the ASP.NET Core Identity cookie auth already in place.

**Scoped to the B2B flow only, as requested** — it does not cover POS or the take-back/loyalty program yet.

- `/account/login`, `/account/register` — plain static HTML forms (not Blazor `EditForm`) posting to minimal-API endpoints in `Program.cs` that call `SignInManager` directly. Registering with a pharmacy name creates a new `Pharmacy` and joins it as staff; leaving it blank registers a plain consumer account.
- `/marketplace` — browse other pharmacies' `ForRedistribution` listings.
- `/marketplace/{id}` — listing detail + place a bid.
- `/bids/mine` — your bids as buyer: accept/reject/counter a seller's counter-offer, or cancel an open negotiation.
- `/bids/incoming` — bids on your own listings as seller: accept/reject/counter a buyer's offer.
- `/orders/mine` — approved bids ready to check out (with optional promo code), plus your purchase and sales history.
- `/orders/{id}` — order detail, invoice download (links directly to the existing `GET /api/orders/{id}/invoice` REST endpoint — the one place the portal reuses the API instead of duplicating logic, since the browser's own auth cookie covers that same-origin request), fulfill (seller), raise a dispute, leave feedback.

### Known architectural shortcut — the portal duplicates controller logic
To move fast, portal pages call `AppDbContext` and the domain services (`INotificationService`, `IPaymentGateway`, `ILoyaltyService`) **directly**, re-implementing the same validation/business rules that already exist in `BidsController`/`OrdersController` (ownership checks, stock/concurrency handling, server-side amount computation) rather than calling those controllers over HTTP. This was a deliberate tradeoff to avoid the complexity of forwarding the Identity auth cookie into internal API calls, but it means **the same business rule now has two places it could drift out of sync**. The right fix, once the portal is confirmed working: extract the logic currently living in `BidsController.Accept/Reject/Counter` and `OrdersController.Checkout` into shared service classes (e.g. `IBidWorkflowService`, extending the pattern already used by `ILoyaltyService`), and have both the API controllers and the portal call those services instead of duplicating the logic inline.

### Known gap — auth form CSRF protection
The plain login/register/logout forms use `.DisableAntiforgery()` in `Program.cs` because they don't currently include an antiforgery token. This should be fixed (via Blazor's `<AntiforgeryToken />` component plus server-side validation) before production — it's the same class of gap (missing CSRF protection) the legacy app's audit flagged as an actively exploitable pattern, just newly introduced here rather than carried over.

### Entities/modules implemented so far
- `Pharmacy`, `ApplicationUser` (FK'd to a pharmacy).
- `Branch`, `Warehouse` — both scoped to a pharmacy with real foreign keys (no denormalized name copies the way the legacy Firestore schema had `pharmacyName`/`branchName` duplicated onto every child record).
- `Category` — simple open-read marketplace taxonomy, admin-write.
- `Product` — the core listing entity. Consolidates the legacy schema's four overlapping status fields (`status`, `productStatus`, `isApproved`, `isRejected`, `isDisposed`) into one `ProductListingStatus` enum, and replaces the legacy's string-typed `expiryDate` (parsed ad hoc with `DateTime.TryParse` at every call site) with a real `DateOnly` column. `AvailableQuantity` (`Quantity - LockQuantity`) is a computed property, not a value mutated independently from multiple call sites.
- `GET /api/products/marketplace` — the MedLoop Connect-style browse endpoint, filtered and paged entirely at the database query level. The legacy equivalent (`MedLoopConnectController.getAllProducts`) fetched a page, then issued one extra Firestore read *per product on the page* just to compute locked quantity — that N+1 pattern doesn't exist here because `AvailableQuantity` needs no follow-up query.
- Ownership checks on every write endpoint that touches tenant data (`BranchesController`, `WarehousesController`, `ProductsController`): a pharmacy/branch/warehouse ID is always derived from the authenticated caller's own account (via `UserManager<ApplicationUser>`), never taken from the request body, and cross-tenant writes return `403`. This directly closes the gap found in the legacy app's `BidApprovalController`/`OfferStatusController`, where approving or rejecting a bid, or finalizing payment, never checked that the caller actually owned the resource being acted on.
- Deletes are soft (`IsActive = false` via `DELETE`, which really does an update) rather than hard deletes, and delete endpoints are real `[HttpDelete]` actions requiring auth — unlike the legacy app, where ~30 delete actions were exposed as unauthenticated `[HttpGet]` endpoints.

### B2B bidding (MedLoop Connect equivalent)
- `Bid` (replaces the legacy `OfferNegotiationModel`/`b2bOffers`), with `BidsController`:
  - `POST /api/bids` — place a bid. `BuyerPharmacyId`/`BuyerUserId` are always derived from the authenticated caller, never from the request body — the legacy `addNegotitation` action never set the equivalent `createdById` field at all, which silently broke the buyer's own "My Offers" screen and every approve/reject notification for the lifetime of that code.
  - The "already bid" check is scoped to `(ProductId, BuyerPharmacyId)` — the legacy check looked at open bids from *any* buyer on the product, so one open bid blocked every other pharmacy from bidding on the same listing at all.
  - Offer quantity is validated server-side against `Product.AvailableQuantity` — the legacy version only validated this in client-side JS.
  - Accepting a bid updates `Product.LockQuantity` under Postgres's `xmin` optimistic-concurrency token (`UseXminAsConcurrencyToken()` in `AppDbContext`), so two acceptances racing to lock the same stock get a `409 Conflict` instead of silently over-locking — the legacy code did a plain read-then-write with no protection against exactly that race.

#### Counter-offers / negotiation
A bid isn't just accept-or-reject — either side can propose new terms back, ping-ponging until one side accepts, either side rejects, or the buyer withdraws. `Bid.Status` tracks whose turn it is (`Pending`/`CounteredByBuyer` → seller's turn; `CounteredBySeller` → buyer's turn), and `Bid.OfferQuantity`/`OfferPricePerUnit` always reflect the current terms on the table — whoever accepts is agreeing to exactly those values, never anything sent in the accept request (it has no body). Every round, including the original offer, is recorded in `BidNegotiationRound` as an append-only audit trail (`GET /api/bids/{id}/history`) — the legacy app's UI hinted at a `"CounteredBySupplier"` status badge but never actually had backend support or any history for it.
  - `PUT /api/bids/{id}/accept` — accepts the current terms, locks stock, moves to `Approved`. Turn-aware: only whichever side it's currently waiting on can call this (`Forbid()` otherwise) — the legacy `BidApprovalController.approvenrejectRequest` had no ownership check at all, so any authenticated caller could approve or reject any bid on any pharmacy's listing, including their own bid.
  - `PUT /api/bids/{id}/reject` — same turn-awareness, requires a reason.
  - `PUT /api/bids/{id}/counter` — propose new quantity/price/message; flips whose turn it is and appends a `BidNegotiationRound`.
  - `POST /api/bids/{id}/cancel` — the buyer withdraws a still-open negotiation outright, in either direction.
  - Paying for an `Approved` bid is `POST /api/orders/checkout`, not a bid endpoint — see below. The legacy equivalent (`OfferStatusController.ProcessBidPayments`) hardcoded `bool overallPaymentSuccess = true;` with no real gateway call — every checkout "succeeded" and the order was marked Paid & Closed without anyone actually being charged. This skeleton's checkout would rather be honestly unimplemented (`MockPaymentGateway`, clearly named) than repeat that.

### Orders and payment
- `Order` + `OrdersController`, with `IPaymentGateway` as a swappable abstraction (`MockPaymentGateway` for now — clearly named, always "succeeds" with a fake reference, registered in `Program.cs`; a real gateway is a one-line DI swap, not a rewrite).
- `POST /api/orders/checkout` (body: just `{ bidId }`) is the fix for the legacy app's most severe payment bug: `PaymentController.ProcessCheckout` took `amount` as a plain query-string parameter and charged whatever the client sent, with no server-side recomputation — any buyer could edit the URL and pay $0.01 for a real order. Here, the amount is *always* recomputed from the bid's own stored quantity/price plus the server-configured `Marketplace:PlatformFeeRate` (`appsettings.json`); the request body has no amount field at all.
- Checkout is wrapped in a DB transaction: the gateway is charged first, then stock is decremented and the `Order` is created atomically — if either fails, the whole thing rolls back. A unique index on `Order.BidId` makes it impossible to create two paid orders for the same bid even under a race, on top of the app-level check.
- Known, documented gap (see the comment on `OrdersController.Checkout`): if the gateway charge succeeds but the DB commit fails, there's currently no automatic refund/reconciliation. That's an explicit TODO to solve *before* swapping in a real (non-mock) gateway — not something to discover in production.

### Order fulfillment and disputes
- `PUT /api/orders/{id}/fulfill` — the selling pharmacy confirms shipment; only valid from `Paid`, ownership-checked (only that order's seller can call it).
- `PUT /api/orders/{id}/dispute` — either the buyer or the seller can raise a dispute with a reason, valid from `Paid` or `Fulfilled`. Replaces the legacy `B2BOrderModel`'s free-floating `BuyerComments`/`SellerDisputeComment` fields — which anyone could set with no real "this order is now disputed" state behind them — with an actual status transition (`OrderStatus.Disputed`) and a recorded `DisputeRaisedBy`/`DisputeReason`/`DisputeRaisedAt`.
- `PUT /api/orders/{id}/resolve-dispute` — **admin-only** (`[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]`), deliberately not left to either party to self-resolve. Resolves to either `Fulfilled` (dispute didn't hold up) or `Refunded` (it did).
- Honest limitation, documented directly in the code: resolving a dispute as `Refunded` only changes the order's status — `IPaymentGateway` has no `RefundAsync` yet, because `MockPaymentGateway` never actually charged anything to refund. Before this goes live against a real gateway, an actual refund call needs to be wired into that endpoint, or "Refunded" orders would silently not be refunded — the same class of bug as the legacy payment stub, just relocated.

### Notifications
- `Notification` + `INotificationService`/`NotificationService`, injected into `BidsController` and `OrdersController` and `await`ed at every lifecycle event: new bid, counter-offer, accept, reject, cancel, order paid, order fulfilled, dispute raised, dispute resolved.
- This is a direct fix for a High-severity finding in the legacy audit: `CommonMethods.addPortalNotification`/`addUserNotification` were declared `async void` and called without `await` throughout `OrderService`/`BidApprovalService` — meaning an exception inside them became unobservable (able to crash the process depending on host) and a request could complete before the notification write finished, silently dropping notifications under load. `NotificationService`'s methods are real `async Task`, and every caller awaits them — a failure here propagates like any other exception instead of vanishing.
- `NotifyPharmacyAsync` fans a notification out to every user belonging to a pharmacy (mirroring the legacy behavior of notifying all of a pharmacy's portal users), by looking up `ApplicationUser`s via the shared `AppDbContext.Users` (inherited from `IdentityDbContext`) — no separate user-lookup table needed.
- `NotificationsController`: `GET /api/notifications/mine` (optionally `?unreadOnly=true`), `PUT /api/notifications/{id}/read`, `PUT /api/notifications/read-all` — all scoped to the calling user's own notifications only.
- Every notification also attempts to send an email via `IEmailSender` (see below) to the recipient's address. Email is treated as a best-effort secondary channel: a failed send is logged and swallowed rather than failing the notification call, since the in-app `Notification` row is always the source of truth. This is a narrow, deliberate exception to "don't swallow errors" — not the blanket catch-everything-silently pattern the legacy app's audit flagged throughout its controllers.

### Email
- `IEmailSender`/`GmailEmailSender` — sends mail via the Gmail API using a Google Workspace service account with domain-wide delegation, impersonating a real mailbox. No SMTP, no password, ever. This is the exact same fix already applied to the legacy `PharmacyWebapp`'s `EmailService` (which originally used raw SMTP with an App Password — the credential that leaked into that repo's git history).
- `IdentityEmailSenderAdapter` wires this into ASP.NET Core Identity's own `IEmailSender<TUser>` hook, which `AddIdentityApiEndpoints` uses for account-confirmation and password-reset emails. **Without this, those emails were silently no-ops** — Identity registers its own no-op sender internally via `TryAdd` if nothing else claims the slot, so this repo had that exact gap until this commit. Registered in `Program.cs` deliberately *after* `AddIdentityApiEndpoints(...)` so it wins.
- Setup required (same manual steps as `PharmacyWebapp`'s equivalent fix, not something this code can do on its own): enable the Gmail API on the GCP project holding your service account; authorize that service account's Client ID for domain-wide delegation with scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send` in Workspace Admin Console; set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the service account key path and `Email:SenderAddress` (`appsettings.json`, currently an empty placeholder) to a real mailbox in that Workspace domain. Until configured, `GmailEmailSender` throws clearly on first use rather than failing silently or crashing the whole app at startup (it's a Scoped service, only constructed when something actually tries to send an email).

### PDF invoices
- `IInvoiceService`/`QuestPdfInvoiceService`, `GET /api/orders/{id}/invoice` — generates and streams back a one-page PDF invoice for a paid order (seller/buyer/product details, line item, platform fee, total, payment reference), ownership-checked the same way as the other order endpoints.
- The legacy app carried **five** PDF libraries (`iTextSharp`, `ABCpdf`, `Aspose.PDF`, `Ghostscript.NET`, `Rotativa`) — a repo-wide grep in the original audit found only `iTextSharp` was ever actually invoked; the other four were dead weight, two of them (`ABCpdf`, `Aspose.PDF`) carrying real commercial license fees for code that did nothing. QuestPDF is the only PDF dependency here.
- **Licensing caveat, called out explicitly rather than assumed away** (see the comment on `QuestPdfInvoiceService`): QuestPDF's free "Community" license only covers organizations under $1M USD annual gross revenue (or non-profit/open source). Confirm MedLoop's eligibility before this ships to production — this is the same class of licensing question the legacy audit flagged for `iTextSharp` (AGPL) and never resolved. Don't repeat that here.

### Scheduled jobs
- Quartz.NET (same library the legacy app used), wired in `Program.cs` with two daily jobs:
  - `NearExpiryNotificationJob` (08:00 UTC) — notifies a pharmacy when one of its own `ForRedistribution` listings is within 30 days of expiry.
  - `MarkExpiredListingsJob` (00:30 UTC) — marks listings past their expiry date as `Disposed` and notifies the owning pharmacy.
- Both jobs fix the exact scheduler bugs the legacy audit found in `EmaiService/SchedulerManager.cs`: every step is wrapped in try/catch and logged via `ILogger<T>` (not `Console.WriteLine`), and one bad row/notification failure logs and moves on instead of silently killing the entire run with nothing useful left in production logs to diagnose it.
- Job classes are registered `Scoped` in DI (`builder.Services.AddScoped<TJob>()`) alongside `q.AddJob<TJob>()` — required because `UseMicrosoftDependencyInjectionJobFactory()` resolves job instances directly from the container, giving each run a fresh `AppDbContext` rather than a long-lived one across runs.

### POS (in-person retail sales)
A separate subsystem from the B2B marketplace — the legacy app kept these in a distinct `Controllers/POS/` folder (`CustomerController`, `POSLoginController`, `ProductController`) for counter sales to walk-in customers, and this repo mirrors that separation under `Controllers/Pos/`.
- `Customer` — a pharmacy's own retail customer (walk-in/loyalty), distinct from `Pharmacy` (a marketplace participant) and `ApplicationUser` (someone who logs in). `CustomersController` (`api/pos/customers`) is pharmacy-scoped the same way `Branches`/`Warehouses` are.
- `PosSale`/`PosSaleItem` — a completed counter transaction and its line items. `SalesController.CreateSale` (`POST api/pos/sales`) takes only product IDs, quantities, an optional customer, and a payment method — **never a price or total**. Every line's price is read from `Product.Price` at the moment of sale and copied onto `PosSaleItem.UnitPriceAtSale` (so a later price change never retroactively changes a past receipt), and `PosSale.TotalAmount` is computed server-side from that. This is the same discipline as `OrdersController.Checkout`, applied here for the same reason: a client-suppliable total is the price-tampering bug in a different part of the app.
- POS sales decrement the same `Product.Quantity`/`AvailableQuantity` pool that B2B bids lock against, wrapped in a transaction with the same `xmin`-concurrency handling as checkout — selling a product at the counter and locking it for a B2B bid can't both succeed for stock that isn't actually there.

### B2C medicine take-back + loyalty points ("dawadaira")
The legacy project's GCP project IDs (`dawadaira-dev`/`dawadaira-live`) referred to this specifically: a **B2C** program, separate from both the B2B marketplace and POS above. A consumer — an `ApplicationUser` with no `PharmacyId`, not affiliated with any pharmacy — returns unused/excess medicine to a partner pharmacy; pharmacy staff verify it in person; a verified return earns the consumer loyalty points.
- `ApplicationUser.LoyaltyPoints` — a materialized balance. The real source of truth is `LoyaltyPointTransaction`, an append-only ledger (same audit-trail discipline as `BidNegotiationRound` for bids) — every earn and redemption is a row, not just a mutated number with no history.
- `TakeBackSubmission` + `TakeBackController`: `POST /api/takeback` (any logged-in consumer, no pharmacy affiliation required — this is the one controller in the app that deliberately does *not* require `PharmacyId`), `GET /api/takeback/mine` (consumer's own history), `GET /api/takeback/incoming` + `PUT /api/takeback/{id}/verify` / `/reject` (the partner pharmacy's queue, ownership-checked the same way bids are).
- Points awarded on verification are **always** `Quantity × Marketplace:LoyaltyPointsPerTakeBackUnit` (`appsettings.json`, default 10) — computed server-side, never entered manually by whoever is verifying, so the reward can't be arbitrarily inflated by a staff member (or a staff member colluding with the submitter).
- `ILoyaltyService`/`LoyaltyService` (`AwardPointsAsync`/`TryRedeemPointsAsync`) does the balance update and ledger insert together; `ApplicationUser` uses the same `xmin` optimistic concurrency token as `Product`, so two concurrent point changes on the same user can't produce a lost update.
- `LoyaltyController`: `GET /api/loyalty/balance` (current balance + recent ledger entries), `POST /api/loyalty/redeem` (deducts points, records the redemption).
- **Deliberate scope boundary**: `redeem` only deducts points and records the ledger entry — it does **not** hand back a discount code or credit usable anywhere, because this skeleton has no consumer-facing storefront yet for points to be spent in (checkout and POS are both pharmacy-side flows, not something a plain consumer buys through). Wiring redemption into an actual purchase happens once that storefront is designed — guessing at that mechanism now would just be inventing business logic nobody asked for.

### Promo codes
- `PromoCode` (admin-managed via `PromoCodesController`, `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]`): a percentage discount, optional expiry, optional max-redemption cap.
- Applied at `POST /api/orders/checkout` via an optional `promoCode` string field — the *only* thing the client sends about it. The discount percentage, validity, and redemption count are all read from the stored `PromoCode` row server-side; the discount is applied to the subtotal before the platform fee is calculated, and the resulting `DiscountAmount` is recorded on the `Order` (and shown on its invoice).
- Redemption counting has the same race-condition protection as stock locking: `PromoCode` also uses `UseXminAsConcurrencyToken()`, and the redemption count is re-checked and incremented inside the same DB transaction as the rest of checkout — two checkouts racing to use the last remaining redemption of a capped code can't both succeed.

### Order feedback
- `OrderFeedback` — one rating (1-5) + optional comment per `(Order, party)`, enforced both in application code and with a unique database index, so a duplicate or racing submission can't slip through either path.
- `POST /api/orders/{id}/feedback` / `GET /api/orders/{id}/feedback` — only valid once an order is `Fulfilled`; either party can leave feedback, and the other party gets notified when they do.
- Replaces the legacy app's implied-but-never-built feedback concept with something structured, rather than free-floating comment fields with no real state behind them (the same pattern already fixed for disputes).

## What's deliberately NOT here yet
Real-time push (these are polled/in-app notifications plus email, not sockets/webhooks), a consumer-facing storefront for spending redeemed loyalty points (see the scope boundary noted above), and the remaining long-tail collections (achievements/badges beyond points, appointments, disposer/technician/distributor workflows). Those get added incrementally per the phased migration plan. A **real** payment gateway integration (replacing `MockPaymentGateway`, and adding an actual refund path) is also still pending — see the gaps noted above before that swap happens.

## Running locally
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
The API comes up on `http://localhost:8080`, with Swagger UI at `/swagger` in Development. Migrations run automatically against the `db` container on startup.

First time only — create the initial EF Core migration before the first run:
```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef   # if not already installed
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
```

## Running against a real (cloud) Postgres instead of the local container
Set the `ConnectionStrings__Default` environment variable (or an untracked `appsettings.Production.json`) to a real connection string — e.g. a Neon.tech database — and skip `docker-compose.yml`'s `db` service.

## Roadmap (maps to the phased migration plan)
1. **This skeleton** — auth + one entity, proves the stack end-to-end. *(done)*
2. Reference data — pharmacies (started here), branches, warehouses, products, categories, plans.
3. Transactional core — orders, B2B offers/bids, settlements. This is also where the MedLoop Connect flow bugs identified in the legacy app's audit (buyer identity never recorded on bid creation, no ownership checks on approve/reject, the payment step being a hardcoded stub) get fixed from scratch instead of ported over.
4. Long-tail modules — notifications, feedback, rewards, promo codes, appointments, disposer/technician/distributor workflows.
5. File storage, PDF generation, email, payment gateway integration, production hosting/deployment.

## Notes for whoever picks this up
- No real secrets are committed anywhere in this repo. The Postgres password in `docker-compose.yml` / `appsettings.Development.json` is a local-only dev default, not a production credential.
- `appsettings.Production.json` is gitignored — production config/secrets should go through environment variables or a secret manager, not a committed file.
- This was scaffolded based on a code audit and stack-migration plan for `PharmacyWebapp` (private repo, same org) — see that repo's audit docs for the full list of findings this rewrite addresses.
